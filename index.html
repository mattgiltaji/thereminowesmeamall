      <h1>How?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>First they claimed that "you can't win a mall"</li>
        <li>However it is possible to win a mall by playing "the most dangerous game"</li>
        <li>They <strong>agreed</strong> to play "the most dangerous game" for the wager of "a mall"</li>
        <li>Whilst <strong> play was ongoing </strong> in "the most dangerous game", they withdrew</li>
        <li>This withdrawal effectively <strong>forfeit their wager</strong></li>
        <li>Therefore they <strong>owe me a mall</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h1>What?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Alas they are unable to procure a mall</li>
        <li>They then tried to <strong>trick me</strong> into accepting a "Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1, built by the German company Liebherr Group" as replacement</li>
        <li>But I know better </li>
        <li>A mall is worth more than a crane with a lifting capacity of 1,200 metric tons, even if that is nearly 700 automobiles</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>However</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>After consulting with the legal powerhouse <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Wild_Wings_Legal_Team">Wild Wings Legal Team</a>, I've been informed that only charitable donations can solve this issue.</li>
        <li>I do not know how this works, I am not a lawyer</li>
        <li>But if they can successfully sue Parker MacMillan III, who am I to question it.</li>
      </ul>
